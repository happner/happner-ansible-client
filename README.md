# happner-ansible-client
Client application for happner-ansible-orchestration based on Semaphore

## DEVELOPER NOTES

As this is based on [Semaphore](https://github.com/ansible-semaphore/semaphore), an open-source client, the provided Dockerfile was used to get things running.

### Semaphore repo

- Clone the Semaphore repo from [https://github.com/ansible-semaphore/semaphore](https://github.com/ansible-semaphore/semaphore) into a local directory

- Modify the default __Dockerfile__ in the root as follows:

  ```bash
  #CMD ["/usr/bin/semaphore", "-config", "/etc/semaphore/semaphore_config.json"]
  CMD ["/bin/ash"]
  ```

- The reason for doing the above is so that you are able to access the shell (to set up the configuration file) rather than starting Semaphore straight away.

### Networking
- In preparation for running Semaphore in a Docker container, you'll need to set up local networking to allow outgoing
       requests from the container to access a local MySQL database:
    - set up an alias on the local loopback interface, eg: 
      `sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.200.10.1/24`
    - to remove this just use: 
      `sudo ifconfig lo0 -alias 10.200.10.1`

### External access to a local MySQL database
Your local database will need to provide external access to the Docker container - see below:

- Ensure that you have a user on the local MySQL database that allows external access, eg:
    - `CREATE USER 'semaphore_user'@'10.100.10.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';` 
    - `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON semaphore.* TO 'semaphore_user'@'10.200.10.1';`
    - `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`
- Check the bindings on the local MySQL using: 
      `ps -ax | grep mysql`
    - this will show a list of processes for MySQL
    - you should see a line that reads 
        `bind-address=...`
    - if this is __127.0.0.1__ you'll need to change the value to the alias created above
    - locate the relevant file to change this value (you should find this in your grep result):
        - if you've used __brew__ to install MySQL, it should be in `usr/local/Cellar/mysql/[version]/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist`
        - `nano /usr/local/Cellar/mysql/5.7.17/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist`
        - change the line that says 
          `<string>--bind-address=127.0.0.1</string>`
           to your alias address or `*` or `0.0.0.0`
        - __BE CAREFUL, IF YOU USE A WILDCARD THIS GIVES ACCESS TO ANYBODY__
    - restart MySQL:
        - `brew services restart mysql`
    - test the remote connection to local MySQL using:
        - `mysql -h 10.200.10.1 -u root -p`

### Docker on OSX
- Use the native Docker installer for OSX rather than the Docker Toolbox:
  - [https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac)

### Docker image
- From the root of the project, build the Docker image using something like:

  `sudo docker build -t happner/ansible-client:v1 .`
- Once its built, start a container as follows:

```bash
docker run -e SEMAPHORE_DB=semaphore -e SEMAPHORE_DB_HOST=10.200.10.1 -e SEMAPHORE_DB_PORT=3306 -e SEMAPHORE_DB_USER=semaphore_user -e SEMAPHORE_DB_PASS=password 
-e SEMAPHORE_ADMIN=admin -e SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_NAME=admin -e SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@test.com -e SEMAPHORE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password -p 3000:3000 -it --rm happner/ansible-client:v1
```

- The above ENV variables will ensure that Semaphore can connect to the local MySQL instance and will also create a default __admin__ user

- Sample output of starting the container:

  ```bash
   > Username:  > Email:  > Your name:  > Password: 
   You are all setup !
   Re-launch this program pointing to the configuration file

  ./semaphore -config /tmp/semaphore/semaphore_config.json
  ....
  ```

  - notice that the location of the semaphore_config.json is in the temp directory in the container. You'll need to move this in the container as follows:

    ```bash
    cp /tmp/semaphore/semaphore_config.json /etc/semaphore/semaphore_config.json
    ```

    â€‹

  - now you can start Semaphore - it will use the config copied above

    ```bash
    /usr/bin/semaphore -config /etc/semaphore/semaphore_config.json
    ```

- The API endpoints should all be displayed in the container terminal

- You'll now be able to access the web application via __localhost:3000__!

  - __*__ the admin login credentials are the ENV vars that you passed in when starting the container (see docker run above):  __admin__ : __password__

- Good luck ;-)
